# Ant Colony Optimization  

## Introduction
Firstly, each ant departs from a city randomly, the next city was selected according to the distance between cities and the concentration of residual pheromone. And then when ants walk all over the cities, each ant leaves pheromones in its path, the less distance ant travels, the more pheromones it left behind. Finally, after several loops, the best path is likely to be selected.
